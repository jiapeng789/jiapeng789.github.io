      <td colspan="5"><div align="justify"> <b>Abstract</b>: Human driving behavior can recognize their driving style. Despite this, it remains pending (i) how the driving style of a naturally aggressive or calm person would evolve and manifest along their driving behavior and (ii) how one individual's driving behavior relates to another driver's behavior. Our insight is that individuals' driving behavior is a sequence of responses/executions to the mixture of some inter-individual shareable latent driving styles inherent in their minds. This paper presents a generic statistical framework to quantitatively analyze the changes in an individual's driving styles that are shareable among individuals.  To learn and analyze these driving styles, we segment sequential driving operations over a temporal space into a fixed granularity as the elemental components of driving styles and formulate the learning task as a topic-extraction problem with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The validation and verification were conducted with 100 drivers in different driving settings, ranging from urban to highway. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can effectively learn the shareable driving styles and describe the dynamic process of driving behavior. We found that three driving styles learned from driving behavior are shared among individual drivers. Naturally aggressive drivers usually have a higher proportion of aggressiveness than other drivers, but they can be calmer according to factors such as the traffic environment. </div>

      <td colspan="5"><div align="justify"> <b>Abstract</b>: Effective driving style analysis is critical to developing human-centered intelligent driving systems that consider drivers' preferences. However, the approaches and conclusions of most related studies are diverse and inconsistent because no unified datasets tagged with driving styles exist as a reliable benchmark. The absence of explicit driving style labels makes verifying different approaches and algorithms difficult. This paper provides a new benchmark by constructing a Natural Dataset of Driving Style (NDDStyle) tagged with the subjective evaluation of 100 drivers' driving styles. In our dataset, the subjective quantification of each driver's driving style is from themselves and an expert according to the Likert-scale questionnaire. The testing routes are selected to cover various driving scenarios, including highways, urban, high-way ramps, and signalized traffic. The collected driving data consists of lateral and longitudinal manipulation information collected from CAN, including steering angle, steering speed, lateral acceleration, throttle position, throttle rate, brake pressure, etc. This driving-style dataset is the first to provide detailed manipulation data with driving-style tags.   </div>
