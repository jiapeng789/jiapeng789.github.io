Hi! I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jianwei Gong at the [Beijing Institute of Technology(BIT)](https://me-english.bit.edu.cn/), China. I received the M.S. degree from BIT in 2021. My research interest lies on achieving **intelligent decision-making** for autonomous vehicles without relying on offline high-precision maps. My research goal is to develop an online and robust method for perceiving and understanding **3D objects** and **road maps** around the vehicle, enabling **map-free decision-making** for autonomous vehicles.
