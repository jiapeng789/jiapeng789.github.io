Hi! I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jianwei Gong at the [Beijing Institute of Technology(BIT)](https://me-english.bit.edu.cn/), China. I received the M.S. degree from BIT in 2021. My research interest lies in the **intelligent perception and decision-making**  of autonomous vehicles in challenging environments and map-free scenarios. My research goal is to develop a scene understanding method based on **robust 3D object detection**, **online high-precision map construction**, and **risk map estimation**, aiming to achieve intelligent decision-making for autonomous vehicle
